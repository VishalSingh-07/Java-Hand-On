### Question 1 - Sum of Odd Integer in an Array

Write main method in Solution class.

In the main method, read five values for an integer array. The main method should print the sum of odd numbers from the
array of integers only if the sum value is greater than 8 and less than 50. Else it should print "NA".

For example: if the values are `1, 2, 3, 5, 7` the sum of odd numbers should be printed as 16.
As in the array - `1, 3, 5, 7` are odd numbers so their sum is `16(1 + 3 + 5 + 7)` which is
greater than 8 and less than 50. The output should be in the format of sample output.

Note: Sum of integers is based on their sign (+ or -)

Example: If two numbers are 11 and -18, their sum will be -7.


Sample Input1:
1
2
3
5
7

Output:
Sum of odd numbers: 16


Sample Input2:
1
2
3
4
8

Output:
NA
